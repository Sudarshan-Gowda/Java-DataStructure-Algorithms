-----------------------------------------

Worst and Average Case Time Complexity: O(n*n). Worst case occurs when array is reverse sorted.

Best Case Time Complexity: O(n). Best case occurs when array is already sorted.

Auxiliary Space: O(1)

Boundary Cases: Bubble sort takes minimum time (Order of n) when elements are already sorted.

Sorting In Place: Yes

Stable: Yes

Due to its simplicity, bubble sort is often used to introduce the concept of a sorting algorithm.
