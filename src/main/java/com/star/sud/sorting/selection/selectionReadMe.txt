Worst Case Time Complexity [ Big-O ]: O(n2)

Best Case Time Complexity [Big-omega]: O(n2)

Average Time Complexity [Big-theta]: O(n2)

Space Complexity: O(1)

=================================

Time Complexity: O(n2) as there are two nested loops.

Auxiliary Space: O(1)
The good thing about selection sort is it never makes more than O(n) swaps and can be useful when memory 
	write is a costly operation.
