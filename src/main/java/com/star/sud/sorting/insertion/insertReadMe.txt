Worst Case Time Complexity [ Big-O ]: O(n2)

Best Case Time Complexity [Big-omega]: O(n)

Average Time Complexity [Big-theta]: O(n2)

Space Complexity: O(1)

Time Complexity: O(n*2)

Auxiliary Space: O(1)

Boundary Cases: Insertion sort takes maximum time to sort if elements are sorted in reverse order. 
			And it takes minimum time (Order of n) when elements are already sorted.

Algorithmic Paradigm: Incremental Approach

Sorting In Place: Yes

Stable: Yes

Online: Yes

Uses: Insertion sort is used when number of elements is small. It can also be useful when input array is 
	almost sorted, only few elements are misplaced in complete big array.
